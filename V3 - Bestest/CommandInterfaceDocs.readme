Computer to ECU:
1: Open Valve
"{1, x}":
  -Open valve index x, see above for physical meaning. Move until limit switch is hit

2: Close valve
"{2, x}":
  -Close valve index x, see above. Move until limit switch is hit



ECU to Computer:
0: Heartbeat, still here
"{0, t}"
  -t is time since ECU turned on in seconds.
  
1: Desired valve states / what the ECU is commanding the valves to be
"{1, x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, ... x13}"
  -xN will either be 1 or 0, 1 indicates valve index N is open, 0 indicates valve index N is closed

2: Detected valve states from limit switches
"{2, x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, ... x13}"
  -xN will either be 1 or 0, 1 indicates valve index N is open, 0 indicates valve index N is closed

3: Battery Voltage
"{3, 7.23}"
  -Single parameter is the read voltage
